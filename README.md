# Algorithms_MIT_OCW
The repository contains the implementation of the algorithms taught in the MIT(OCW) lecture series of algorithms.
The algorithms are implemented on python 3.5.
As of now the repository contains:-

1) Peak finding for 1-D and 2-D array
2) Vanilla insertion sort
3) Merge sort
4) Heap sort
5) BST sort

NOTE-
In case you're running the python script on sublime text you would need a package named sublimeREPL for taking the input in the python script.
The link for the package is:- https://packagecontrol.io/installation

A detailed tutorial for the package installation can be found at:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2LbXCkLDI
